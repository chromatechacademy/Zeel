------ LOCATOR NOTES ------

- Currently as of June, 2022 Selenium WebDriver offers 8 different ways to locate 
web page elements (HTML elements)

- In order to perform any action on an element, such as sending text, clicking, etc
we need to locate an element to interact with 

- A locator can also be referenced as the address to an element
Locators:
1. className - will not work if the attribute value has spaces (compound class)
2. cssSelector
3. ID
4. linkText - you need the ENTIRE text of the link 
5. name
6. partialLinkText - you only need a part of the link text
7. tagName
8. xpath
